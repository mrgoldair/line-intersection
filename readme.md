# Line Intersection



**How do we test for the intersection of two line segments? Comparing overlaps of $x$ and $y$ values of line segment end points?**

First we need to convert the coordinate forms ${x,y}$ into parametric form
$$
p = (1-s)a + sb
$$
Method

------

The event queue ($Q$) is not merely a FIFO queue, but its prioritised on $y$, then $x$ value in first max, then min order â€“ e.g. we sweep the line from the top and encounter those segment end points with the maximum $y$ values. When two segment end points have the same $y$ value, that with the smallest $x$ value has priority. Thus the event queue pulls out segment end points from top-bottom, left-right.

Adding segments to the status structure ($T$) this way means we add segments from top-bottom, left-right.

Testing adjacent segments (leaf nodes that are side-by-side) within $T$ for intersection may yield an intersection below the sweep line. This is the third type of event point (the first two being start and end points of a segment). The intersection point is added to the queue ($Q$). When the sweep line dequeues an intersection point we know to record that point in the output and also swap the relevant segments (as segments swap order after an intersection) and test against their new adjacents in $T$
